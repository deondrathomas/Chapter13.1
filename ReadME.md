<li>HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:                       </li>

<p>#3. "System.out.println("Rating: " + rating);" gets the rating . And "System.out.println("Title + title" gets the title
#21. The while loop, because im used to doing while loop i've never use the for loop
Conclusion Questions: 
1. While (condition) { 
                             // code
                             // so-called "loop body"
                           }
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) { // shows 0, then 1, then 2
  alert(i);
}
While loop is good because its more easier then a for loop, it has less coding involved. And For loops are good for creating games.
2. The major change in Android Os 3.0 they fixed bugs, changed the Android API, and added a system bar. And Gingerbread became cumbersome because it's and old version so its harder to use.
